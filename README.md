#French Bakery Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)
Overview
This repository contains the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the French Bakery Dataset. The dataset comprises sales data from a fictional French bakery, including information about products, transactions, and customer demographics.

The purpose of this EDA is to gain insights into the bakery's sales patterns, understand customer behavior, and identify opportunities for business improvement.
Analysis
The EDA is divided into several sections:

Data Loading and Inspection: In this section, we load the dataset and inspect its structure, including data types, missing values, and basic statistics.

Data Cleaning: Here, we handle missing values, perform data type conversions, and address any inconsistencies or errors in the dataset.

Exploratory Data Analysis: This is the core of the analysis, where we explore the data to uncover patterns and trends. We examine sales trends over time, popular products, customer demographics, and more.

Visualizations: To better understand the data, we create visualizations such as histograms, bar charts, and time series plots.

Key Insights: Based on the analysis, we summarize key findings and insights that can inform business decisions and strategies.
